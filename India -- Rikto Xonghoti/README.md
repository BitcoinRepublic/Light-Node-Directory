Anurag Saikia, Basanta Goswami and Pallab J D Goswami, from left to right, are the faces behind Xonghoti. Anurag and Basanta met over Twitter and decided to spread Bitcoin education within their community. In the process they ended up orange pilling Pallab who then made an effort to learn more about Bitcoin and now leads the efforts around the MPB diploma.
