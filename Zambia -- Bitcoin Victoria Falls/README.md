## üìñ About Us
In late 2022 I visited El Zonte, El Salvador and saw the impact that The Hope House and the Bitcoin Beach project was having on the local community. I set out to replicate this project and thought that the Free Haven Community Initiative in Livingstone, Zambia was very similar in its origin to The Hope House and could be a good starting point.

I reached out to the Founder, Samantha Knaub, who is friends with my Sister, we are all from the Delaware / Maryland area in the United States. I have also been philanthropically donating to the Free Haven Community Initiative for 6+ years. After a few emails, Samantha introduced me to the President of Free Haven, Forest Hall. He was open to the Bitcoin Circular Economy idea and brought in Jason Peck as another volunteer for this project. We met together monthly starting in January 2023.

In late 2023 with the project agreed upon by all parties we began seeking a teacher with the help of Ndesanjo Macho "Ndesa" from Lusaka. Ndesa is also the Bitcoin For Fairness Zambia organizer. We were introduced to Ndesa by Anita Posch, Founder of Bitcoin for Fairness, who will also share Bitcoin knowledge with our teacher(s).

The project is ready and we need your help to fund it! We have two teachers, Mabvuto and Humphrey who are both part of Bitcoin for Fairness Zambia. We will begin by advertising a 5-week Mi Primer Bitcoin / My First Bitcoin class for Free Haven Community Initiative University and High School students, enrollment will also be open to the public. We are hoping to start in February or March, pending funding. We hope to offer this course 3 different times in 2024 with 15-20 students per class.

Mabvuto and Humphrey also recommended a Bitcoin meetup, which we will host 6 times in 2023 at Jollyboys Backpackers, a merchant that currently accepts Bitcoin in Livingstone.

We will need funds to pay the teacher, print out the Mi Primer Bitcoin workbooks, have light refreshments for the graduation ceremony, host F&B for the Bitcoin meetups, and have miscellaneous funds for teaching the learners to download lightning apps and run activities. During their time each week in Livingstone, Mabvuto and Humphrey hope to onboard merchants as well.
