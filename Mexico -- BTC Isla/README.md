## 📍 Location

- **City:** Isla Mujeres

## 📖 About Us
Vision
My goal is to transform this island and give its people the freedom that's been taken from them. And to lead this 'Bitcoin revolution,' I will need a lot of help. Because as of right now, it's me against the island.
Game Plan
Of course, the idea is crazy, but don't they tell us, "If your dreams do not scare you, they are not big enough?" Well, this one is scary as f***. I'm in a foreign country governed by corruption. But I digress.
The game plan is to orange pill the locals of all ages and onboard businesses.
PHASE 0
👉 Apply to become a Node in Mi Primer Bitcoin
👉 Get a roadmap and tips from MOTIV and other Bitcoin education programs
👉 Find a lightning wallet that is easy to use in Mexico
👉 Find a location for classes
👉 Find a location for Bitcoin Meet-ups
PHASE 1
👉 Get accepted to Mi Primer Bitcoin
👉 Reach out to any Bitcoiners on the island
👉 Organize the first Bitcoin meet-up
👉 Find people who are willing to be educated and ready to stop being slaves to the system
PHASE 2
👉 Get onboarded to Mi Primer Bitcoin
👉 Meet with the co-founder of the lightning wallet
👉 Get one restaurant to start accepting Bitcoin
PHASE 3
👉 Get five restaurants to accept Bitcoin
👉 Begin the first class for kids
👉 Begin the first class for teenagers and adults
PHASE 4
👉 Get 20 restaurants and businesses to accept Bitcoin
👉 Host three meet-ups
👉 Find a teacher to help
👉 Continue the 10-week Mi Primer Bitcoin course
PHASE 5
👉 Get 50 restaurants and businesses to accept Bitcoin
👉 Try to get the taxi labor union to join the course or accept Bitcoin
👉 Get the tours on the island to accept Bitcoin
👉 Find farmer markets
So far, this is my roadmap to Orange Pill the island. My main focus is to teach as many people who are willing to learn and onboard as many businesses as I can. This project is just the beginning, and if creating a Bitcoin circular economy on an isolated island works, then why couldn't we continue to do it in other parts of the world? After all, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and it solves the medium of exchange problem for remittances in underdeveloped countries with highly volatile currencies.
As they say, there is only one way to eat an elephant, and it's a bite at a time! So, if you are up for the challenge and want to be part of this story, welcome :)
## 👥 Our Team
Introduction
Hi, firstly, I would like to introduce myself and explain how I ended up in a 13 km island off the coast of Cancun with a goal to create a Bitcoin circular economy here. My name is Isabella Santos, and I am the co-founder of Get Based, a Bitcoin media company, and the creator of Bitcoin Backstage, a show that airs every Friday on all Bitcoin Magazine platforms.

How Did I Get Here?
I left my fiat job in March of 2023 to go all-in on the Bitcoin standard. In December of that year, a good friend of mine known as Kinetic Finance (Julian Figueroa) invited me to shoot a documentary in Peru, my home country. The purpose of this trip was to show the world how MOTIV, a non-profit with the mission to build programs for people in impoverished communities by educating them about Bitcoin, was creating circular Bitcoin economies in the outskirts of Peru in cities like Iquitos, Quebrava Verde, Tarapoto, Cusco, etc.

Anyway, the point is, being there and watching how Bitcoin was being used as a tool for freedom, while also saving and changing lives, I realized I needed to do the same. That is when I decided to leave Miami and see if I too could create a Bitcoin circular economy and liberate people who are trapped by the corrupt systems we famously know as governments.
So, in February of 2024, I packed my bags and moved to Isla Mujeres, an island with about 22,000 people.
