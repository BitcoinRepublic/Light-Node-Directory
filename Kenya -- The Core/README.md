### 💻 Google Classroom Setup:
With the help of the Myfirst Bitcoin team, we managed to set up a Google Classroom, which is very convenient for our Bitcoin Diploma education. We were previously using ordinary Google Meet, which was a bit manual for the entire education process.

### 💰 First Grant by Geyser on 20th Sep 2023:

We applied for the Geyser grant for Bitcoin education and are glad to have received a grant of $153 on September 20, 2023. This marks our first successful grant application.
